# Open Questions:

### 1

# Do we want to hard delete (completely remove from cache) or soft delete (fill in a 'deleted_at')
# --> At the cost of storage space, I think we should do soft deletes - you never know when you might need some data again.

### 2

# Record "40a36493-f450-4331-874c-5ef01aabe1d5" was not inserted before the 'UPDATE' was given
# In these situations - do we prefer the record to be inserted anyways or ignored?
# --> I think we should insert them anyways, then clean the duplicates later
# --> This means that for cases like the above (update comes before the insert) - there will be duplicate records.
